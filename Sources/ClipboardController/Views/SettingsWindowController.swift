/// uses the menu bar, and `SettingsLink` opens the window without activating the
/// app. The window therefore opened behind the windows of the front application
/// and looked like it never opened at all. It appeared only later, together with
/// the About panel, because `showAbout()` calls `NSApp.activate()`.
///
/// This controller follows `RenameClipController`: AppKit owns the window, so the
/// code activates the app and orders the window to the front by hand.
